# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project is a day scheduler. The page will automatically open up to the current date with timeslots for the entire day. The user will be able to add in a task or plans that they have for any given hour. Once the save button is clicked, the task is saved to local storage on their browser. The time slots are also color coded. Timeslots that are past the current hour will become grey, the current timeslot is black, and future timeslots are green.

Here is a screenshot of the site below.
